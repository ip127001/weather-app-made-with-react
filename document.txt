1. Get the coordinates of the place which is selected
    First we open the application we are presented with a search bar.
    As long as we type in search bar we have suggestions of places using google places api.
    We click on place and then event listener triggered.
    Then we get longitude and latitude from Address Object.

2. Get the current weather information
    Se the coordinates received from Address Object using setState({}) method
    Then send the get request to openWeatherMap data api to get the current weather data for that place.
    If we successfully get the data then in then() method do the following:-
        - set the temperature, humidity, rain, min_temp, max_temp and weather icon in the state.
        - send the get request to openWeatherMap forcast api to get 5days forcast data for that place.
    - If we successfully get the data then in then() method do the following:-
        - According to dates we set the each day weather data to 4 arrays.
        - Then set the state object properties(data_arr_1...) to each day data.
3. UI gets updated with current and next 3 days data.
    If the sucessfully get data from 'data API' then tabular data gets updated and rendered in UI.
    If the succesfully get data from 'forcst API' then a today & 3-days forcast navigation is rendered in UI.
